Version 2.2.1 (being developed)
===============================

* WCSLIB:

  * changed to version 4.19

* Module wcs:

  * added option to create a 'minimal' Projection object when a full
    object cannot be created due to errors in the FITS header.

* Module maputils:

  * added Astropy support.

  * various improvements and extensions.

* Module mplutil:

  * added sunbow color maps.

  * in class AxesCallback use weak references to Axes objects.

* Bug fixes.

Version 2.2 (Apr 19, 2012)
==========================

* Class maputils.FITSimage:

  * Method header2classic() returns a tuple with three elements.
    The last one used to be a boolean but it is now a list with
    FITS keywords that have been changed.

* Class rulers.Ruler:

  * now supports rulers specified by a start position, a size and an
    angle w.r.t. the North.

  * new method *set_title()* for labeling a ruler.

* Module mplutil:

  * new class CanvasCallback.

  * work-around to add support for resize events to matplotlib's
    Qt4Agg backend.

  * work-around for matplotlib's (>=1.1.0) changed callback registry. 

* WCSLIB:

  * changed to version 4.13.4

  * use WCSLIB's new error diagnostics system

* New module kmpfit:

  * provides new class Fitter for solving least-squares problem using
    the Levenberg-Marquardt technique. It is based on the implementation
    in C of Craig Markwardt's MPFIT routines.

* Documentation:

  * several improvements.

Version 2.1 (Feb 14, 2011)
==========================

* Class wcs.Projection:

  * added attribute *category*

  * fixed ZPN projection related problem in method *mixed()*

  * minimal FITS headers are now accepted

  * added support for *grid coordinates*, i.e., CRPIX-relative pixel
    coordinates. Methods *pixel2grid()* and *grid2pixel()*.

  * added method *str2pos()* for converting positions represented as strings
    to world- and pixel coordinates.

* Module maputils:

  * added new class *Skypolygon* for plotting shapes like ellipses,
    rectangles and regular polygons. For these shapes
    angles and distances along a great circle are preserved.
    This class can be used for example to draw footprints on all-sky
    plots or a beam to show the resolution of an instrument.

  * improved position information in toolbar.  Message format can be
    changed by user/programmer. 
  
  * support for RGB images. RGB values are displayed in message toolbar.
  
  * class FITSimage: improved versions of *header2classic()* and
    *reproject_to()* methods;
    new *slice2world()* method prints information about
    slice positions (annotate 2d maps from a 3d data cube).

  * catch error if *event.key* is None for Caps Lock keys

  * get rid of 'new' keyword in histogram

  * blur defaults improved

  * *str_header()* method was unable to print dictionary (external) headers.
    Fixed.


* Module mplutil:

  * work-around for special keys which are defined in matplotlib's GTKAgg
    backend but 'missing' from the Qt4Agg backend.
    The following keys are made available: 'pageup', 'pagedown',
    'left', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'home', 'end'.

* Module positions:

  * units 1/...  and /...  also recognized.  Can be used for spectral
    translations that transform to e.g.  AWAV. 

  * introduced '?' character as wildcard for units.

  * introduced case insensitive minimal match for 'UNITS' as a replacement
    for header units.

  * all column, row and line numbers now start with 1.


* Module shapes:

  * messages for toolbar improved.
  
  * changed conversion routine to support shapes on maps with only one
    spatial axis (e.g. position-velocity maps).
    
  * GUI improved.
  
  * improved writing shape data to file.

  * catch error if *event.key* is None for Caps Lock keys

  * improved moving objects (from within any point within the ellipse)

  * improved rotation ellipse

  * improved sampling on ellipse

  * added rotation to rectangles

  * changed writing position to terminal with left mouse button to combination
    of left mouse button and shift key. This prevents interference with
    module shapes where one drags a shape with the left mouse button.


* Module wcsgrat:

  * fixed bug with precision in seconds.

  * use positions module to evaluate expressions for startx and starty
    parameter in Graticule class.

  * use positions module to evaluate expressions for deltax and deltay
    parameter in Graticule class.

  * introduced a syntax to set labels in LaTeX in exponential format.

  * sexagesimal labeling with h, m, s characters or with superscripts with
    Boolean parameter *texsexa*.

  * allow Graticule parameter *unitsx* and *unitsy* also to be applied to
    non-offset axes. (Examples in maputils tutorial).

  * minutes and seconds labeling for negative declinations get '-' sign

  * center of offset axis can be changed with parameter *startx*, *starty*
    and a string as argument.

  * Right Ascension labels in TeX (hms) now have better alignment.

* New module profiles:

  * added function *gauest()* for estimating gaussian components in
    a profile. These estimates can e.g. subsequently be used as initial
    estimates for a least squares fit.

* WCSLIB: changed to version 4.7 (from 4.5)


Version 2.0.2 (Sep 16, 2010)
============================

* Class wcs.Projection:

  * allow for FITS headers that incorrectly represent EQUINOX as a string

  * added support for AIPS keyword VELREF

* Function mplutil.gipsy_connect() connects GIPSY keyword events
  to Matplotlib event loop.

* Added Microsoft Windows support.


Version 2.0.1 (Aug 11, 2010)
============================

  it does not need to be separately installed anymore.

  and *src_offset*.

* Class wcs.Projection:

  * fixed bug in class WrappedHeader.

  * allow for WSRT files with topocentric frequencies (via class WrappedHeader)

  * added attribute *altspecarg*.

* Added modules *rulers* and *shapes*.

* Included SciPy modules *filters* and *interpolation*. The latter was slightly
  modified.


Version 1.9.1 (Feb 25, 2010)
============================

* Class wcs.Projection:

  * added attribute *euler*.

  * fixed bug in method *mixed()*

  * added NumPy array as possible source.

  * added method *set_length()*



Version 1.9 (Jan 16, 2010)
==========================

* First public release.
