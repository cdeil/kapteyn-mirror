Installation Instructions
=========================

Requirements for installing this package are Python, numpy
and a suitable C compiler. For using it, the availability
of PyFITS and matplotlib is recommended.

There are three installation options:

1. To install the package, run the setup.py script in this
   directory as follows:

      python setup.py install

   This will install the package into your Python system.

2. If you prefer not to modify your Python installation,
   create a directory under which to install the package
   e.g., mydir. Then install as follows:

      python setup.py install --install-lib mydir

   To use the package you then need to include mydir in
   your PYTHONPATH.

3. If you want to use this package only for GIPSY, you can
   install it as follows:

      python setup.py install --install-lib $gip_exe

   The GIPSY installation procedure normally does this automatically, so
   usually this will not be necessary.
